# Advice Process

## Abstract

The two most familiar organizational decision making approaches are: command hierarchy, and consensus.  Within the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), which maintains the RFC (Request For Comments) format on which the Corporate RFC format is based on, there also exists a concept of a rough consensus.  Rough consensus, for the purposes of this document, falls into the consensus category. This document describes an alternative decision making approach: advice process.  A command hierarchy is the fastest decision making approach.  Consensus is the most information inclusive decision making approach.  Advice process is an approach that makes a tradeoff between decision making speed and information inclusivity.  This tradeoff enables fast decisions that include information most relevant to the decision being made.
