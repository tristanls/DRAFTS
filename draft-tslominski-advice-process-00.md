# Advice Process

## Abstract

The two most familiar organizational decision making approaches are: command hierarchy, and consensus.  Within the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), which maintains the RFC (Request For Comments) format on which the Corporate RFC format is based on, there also exists a concept of a rough consensus.  Rough consensus, for the purposes of this document, falls into the consensus category. This document describes an alternative decision making approach: advice process.  A command hierarchy is the fastest decision making approach.  Consensus is the most information inclusive decision making approach.  Advice process is an approach that makes a tradeoff between decision making speed and information inclusivity.  This tradeoff enables fast decisions that include information most relevant to the decision being made.

## 1. Introduction

Organizational decision making calls for consideration of many contexts and scales, is subject to many constraints, requires coordination between people, and asks people to make decisions. The people who make up an organization have a finite cognitive capability.  As a result, contexts, scales, constraints, and coordination that any one person can consider and engage in is finite as well.  Additionally, there exists a universal constraint of all decision making: time available.  The Advice Process is a decision making heuristic that compensates for finite cognitive capability while at the same time minimizing time to decision.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) [[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)] [[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## 1. Advice Process

Advice Process can be stated as follows: any person can make any decision after seeking advice from 1) people who have expertise and/or perspective on the topic, and 2) people who will be meaningfully affected and will have to live with the decision.

Advice Process is initiated by anyone who notices a problem, an opportunity, or is otherwise motivated to act.

The person who initiated the Advice Process (decision maker) SHALL decide. Consensus is not required and is not a goal at any point in the process. The advice received during the Advice Process can be discarded, partially accepted, or fully followed by the decision maker.

Once the decision is made, the decision maker SHOULD inform people who provided advice of the decision.
